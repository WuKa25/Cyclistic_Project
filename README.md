- members - who are paying for membership in subscription-based model,
- causals - who use Cyclistic's offer spontaneously,

in order to descriptively determine habits of clients. <br/>Project includes recommendations, which might help in transition of casual clients into subscription members.<br/>Database used was provided by Motivate International Inc.
